# Ignore the Python virtual environment
venv/
__pycache__/

# Ignore the local vector database
chroma_db/
demo_chroma_db/

# --- MOST IMPORTANT PART ---
# Ignore secret files like your .env file
.env

# Ignore temporary files created by the app
temp_*

# Ignore IDE and OS files
.vscode/
.idea/
.DS_Store


Now, Git will completely ignore these files and folders, so your `authtoken` (which should be in your `.env` file for local use) will never be uploaded.

#### **Step 3: Upload to GitHub**

Now you can safely upload your code.

1.  **Initialize Git:** Open your command prompt in your project folder and run:
    ```bash
    git init
    ```
2.  **Add and Commit:**
    ```bash
    git add .
    git commit -m "Initial commit of Document QnA RAG system"
    ```
3.  **Create and Link a GitHub Repository:**
    * Go to [GitHub](https://github.com/) and create a new, empty repository.
    * Copy the commands they provide under "...or push an existing repository..." and run them in your command prompt. They will look like this:
        ```bash
        git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
        git branch -M main
        git push -u origin main
        ```

Your code is now safely on GitHub without any of your secrets!

### Part 2: Deploying Your App for Free (Streamlit Community Cloud)

"Deploying" just means putting your app on a public server so anyone can use it. Since you built a Streamlit app, the easiest and best place to deploy it for free is the **Streamlit Community Cloud**.

Think of this as moving your project from your **private kitchen (your computer)** to a **public restaurant (the internet)** where anyone can come and try your creation.

#### **Step 1: Sign Up and Link Your Account**

1.  Go to [share.streamlit.io](https://share.streamlit.io) and sign up for a free account. It's easiest to sign up using your GitHub account.
2.  Authorize Streamlit to access your GitHub repositories.

#### **Step 2: Deploy the App**

1.  In your Streamlit dashboard, click **"New app"**.
2.  Select your new GitHub repository from the dropdown. The branch should be `main` and the main file path should be `app.py`.
3.  **The Secret Sauce:** Click on the **"Advanced settings..."** button. Go to the **"Secrets"** section. This is where you will securely give your online app the `ngrok` authtoken it needs, without ever putting it in your code.
4.  In the Secrets box, paste this, replacing the placeholder with your actual token:
    ```
    NGROK_AUTHTOKEN="YOUR_ACTUAL_NGROK_AUTHTOKEN_HERE"
    ```
5.  Click **"Save"**.
6.  Click the **"Deploy!"** button.

Streamlit will now automatically pull your code from GitHub, install all the libraries from `requirements.txt`, and launch your application on a public URL. This might take a few minutes.

### Part 3: The Final Touch - A Professional `README.md`

Your GitHub repository is the "front door" of your project. A good `README.md` file explains what your project is and how to use it.

**Action:** Replace the content of your `README.md` file with the text below. It makes your project look professional and helps others (and your future self!) understand it.
